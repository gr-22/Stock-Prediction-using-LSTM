# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM
This is my 2nd task for Bharat Intern under the intership program of 'Data Science intern'.
The project included gathering past stock price information for a specific stock; in this case, we will use Tesla Stocks Inc. To eliminate any outliers or noise, the data was then pre-processed. After that, the pre-processed data was used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. In order to predict future stock prices, the LSTM model had to understand the patterns in the stock price data. Several metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), were used to assess the predictions. The outcomes demonstrated that the LSTM model was able to forecast future stock prices with accuracy. The assignment was finished as part of the project for a data science intern. The project's objective was to gain experience withÂ  LSTM models to predict stock prices.
